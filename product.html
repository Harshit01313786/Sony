            <h2>Sony α350</h2>
            <p>The Sony α 350 was introduced in Japan in March 2008. It has a 14.2 megapixel CCD sensor, the second highest pixel count for an APS-C format DSLR at the time of its launch, marginally exceeded by the Pentax K20D CMOS sensor.The Live View is provided by a secondary low-resolution video sensor placed in the mirror-prism housing to provide a view of the focusing screen, which allows retention of phase-contrast autofocus. Live View is mechanically switched via a moving mirror surface. When Live View is active, the normal exposure metering is replaced by metering from the LV image itself offering many more zones or points, along with more accurate white balance. This system is shared with the Sony Alpha 300, a 10.2 megapixel variant.</p>

            <h2>Sony α NEX-5</h2>
            <p>The α NEX-5 has features found in SLR cameras but also some that are normally found in point and shoots. The body of the α NEX-5 is made of magnesium alloy that separates the NEX-5 from the less expensive polymer NEX-3. Also different from the NEX-3 is video quality. The NEX-5 can shoot in AVCHD 1080/60i HD. There is a 7 frame/s continuous shot mode, with autofocus disabled after the first frame. The APS-C sized sensor has an ISO sensitivity up to 12,800.[3] The camera software has special features like twilight mode and sweep panorama. The latter lets the photographer sweep across a city-sky line or similar long view and have the photos automatically stitched into a JPEG image on camera.</p>

            <h2>Sony α6000</h2>
            <p>The Sony α6000 (model ILCE-6000)[1] is a digital camera announced 12 February 2014.[2] It is a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (MILC), which has a smaller body form factor than a traditional DSLR while retaining the sensor size and features of an APS-C-sized model. It is targeted at professionals, experienced users, and enthusiasts. It replaced the NEX-6 and NEX-7.[3] Review websites note that although the α6000 uses a 24 MP sensor like the Sony NEX-7, the Sony α6000 can also be seen as more of a replacement of the Sony NEX-6.[4] In the Firmware version 1.10, an android subsystem was added. The sub system was used to run Sony's apps.At the time of its release, the Sony α6000 was advertised featuring the "world's fastest autofocus" with lag of 0.06 second and 11 fps continuous shooting with tracking AF. Its MSRP is $700 with a 16–50 mm power-zoom kit lens f/3.5-5.6.[5]Despite the announcement of an updated model in February 2016, the α6300,[6] Sony has said they will continue production of the α6000.</p>

            <h2>Sony α 700</h2>
            <p>The Sony α700 (DSLR-A700) was the second model launched in the Sony α series of APS-C sensor digital single-lens reflex cameras, following the α100, with several improvements over the latter. Some of the camera's technology was inspired by the former Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D, such as the man-machine command interface/commands, LCD menus, viewfinder, and lens mount.On March 8, 2007, at the PMA Trade Show, Sony announced two new α cameras, both positioned to be "above" the α100 in the Alpha line-up in terms of price and functionality. One model was referred to as a "high amateur" model, with a release date of late 2007. The α700 was discontinued, and its successor, the A77 (SLT-A77), was announced on August 24, 2011, with availability from October 2011.</p>

            <h2>Sony α99 II</h2>
            <p>The Sony α99 II is a flagship Sony SLT camera and continues the line of Sony A-mount camera bodies.[1] It was first announced by Sony on September 19, 2016 at photokina 2016 and replaced the original Sony α99. Its single-lens translucent design allows for faster focusing and shooting than DSLRs.[2] Consequently, at 12 FPS, it can shoot roughly twice as fast in continuous burst mode as competing models as of 2016.[3] The α99 II also features best-in-class low-light autofocus.[vague]Initial demand for the camera exceeded the supply in Japan[4] and major American retailers also quickly sold out of allocated amounts and had backordered supplies as of December 2016.[citation needed]The a99 II was the last a-mount camera. After five years from its launch, Sony decided to discontinue all a-mount cameras including the a99 II, in 2021.[5][6] That was the end of the a-mount cameras lineup that lasted 36 years from 1985 during the Minolta SLR film era until 2021 with Sony digital SLT technology.</p>

            <h2>Sony NEX-C3</h2>
            <p>The Sony NEX-C3 is a digital camera announced 8 June 2011.[2] It is a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with a compact form factor and APS-C size image sensor. The Sony camera was manufactured in Black, Silver, and Pink.[3] This camera was unfairly compared against later models such as the NEX-5R using a body only weight of 225g compared the NEX-5R battery and card inclusive weight of 276g, which lead to the mistaken claim that the NEX-C3 was 51g lighter.[4] The camera was later replaced by the NEX-F3.</p>
